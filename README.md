# AfriNLP

I have added two notebooks for a baseline model for each of yoruba and hausa. The accuracies are above 80%, showing that the data is good.

I have also divided the datasets into train and test sets to allow for testing in case we have several models and want to select the overall best.

Waiting on the igbo dataset now.
